    "Adding gender information to the dataset can provide valuable insights into the potential gender-based variations in diabetes outcomes. This additional feature would enable us to explore whether there are differences in diabetes risk, progression, or response to treatments between the genders. By including gender as a predictor variable, we can conduct more granular analyses, identify potential gender-specific risk factors, and tailor interventions for improved diabetes management. Gender is a fundamental demographic factor that can significantly enhance the depth and accuracy of our predictive models and inform personalized healthcare strategies."
